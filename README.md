# Welcome to **WTF Ducks**

## Before You Start!

This may turn some people away, so read these first:

- **We are a competitive faction.** If you want to crush players at your age/level and push yourself to be the best, youâ€™re in the right place. If you want a casual faction, this isnâ€™t it.
- **Hit Level 15 within 10 days.** We have XP-boost weapons available and most members hit it sooner if theyâ€™re active. If you do **not** hit Level 15 in time, you will be kicked.
- **Postâ€“Level 15 requirements:**  
  - Live in a **Private Island** (rented or owned)  
  - **Donator** status (buyable on the item market for ~20â€“25m)  
  - Take **2Ã— Xanax per day**  
  - **Participate in crimes** (easy moneyâ€”just click to join)

> The best players do these basics consistently. Many of our members started new and now compete in massive wars against top veterans.

### Armory Access (after 72 hours)
There are items in the armory available once your recruit status ends (72h). XP-bonus weapons may be removed when you go offline so others can use them. If youâ€™ll be offline for a while, **return** them to the armory from your items page. If you didnâ€™t get one, ask a council/leaderâ€”after 3 days you can lend it to yourself.

---

## Payouts & Why This Matters

- **Rank wars pay based on performance**â€”a great way to stack cash for your progression.
- **Organized Crimes (OCs)** pay on each success. These two are the biggest money-makers and a huge reason to be in a strong faction like the WTF family.

---

## Trust & Safety

**Do not be overly trusting with membersâ€”especially newer ones.**  
No one should be asking for money/items beyond small amounts for travel/rehab. Scamming, multi bans, quitting, or getting kicked are common among players with \<150 days in faction. **Never** lend to gamblers (caches count as gambling): they will lose and gamble your loan/items.

## What Should You Be Doing?

All you need are **3 steps** to be a successful member:

### Step 1) Hit Level 15 (your only focus at first)
We are competitive and require you to level **within 10 days** of joining. Itâ€™s game-changing and mandatory.

### Step 2) Start Making Money
Youâ€™ll need cash to fund Xanax, a Private Island, and Donator status.

- **Quick tips**
  - Buy and use **Beer** (100 each, up to 100/day) at **Bits n Bobs** in the City (restocks periodically).
  - Be at **â‰¥50%** before joining Level 1/2 **Organized Crimes**.
  - With serious daily crimes, reaching 100s in crime counts, you can reach **~45m/week** after a year.  
    End-game Level 10 crimes can reach **~150m/week**.

### Step 3) Learn the Fundamentals
Pace yourself, but read these before war/chainsâ€”theyâ€™re your **third** major moneymaker (after flying and OCs).
